## Learning objectives

In this directory, we will find a compilation of files that will help us to understand the uses modules and import functions in python and help us to answer the next questions:

 1.   How to import functions from another file
  2.   How to use imported functions
   3.   How to create a module
    4.   How to use the built-in function  `dir()`
     5.   How to prevent code in your script from being executed when imported
      6.   How to use command line arguments with your Python programs

 - 2-args.py is a program that prints the number of and the list of its arguments.
 - 3-infinite_add.py is a program that prints the result of the addition of all arguments
