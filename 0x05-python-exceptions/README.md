In this repository, we will find a compilation of files that will help us to understand the concepts of errors and execption in python and help us to answer the next questions:

 1.   What’s the difference between errors and exceptions
 2.   What are exceptions and how to use them
 3.   When do we need to use exceptions
 4.   How to correctly handle an exception
 5.   What’s the purpose of catching exceptions
 6.   How to raise a builtin exception
 7.   When do we need to implement a clean-up action after an exception
