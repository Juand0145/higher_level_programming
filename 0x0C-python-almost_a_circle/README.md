## Python - Almost a circle
In this directory, we will find a compilation of files that will help us to understand and how to use some aplicatiion in the OOP in Python and help us to answer the next questions:

  -   What is Unit testing and how to implement it in a large project
  -   How to serialize and deserialize a Class
  -   How to write and read a JSON file
  -   What is  `*args`  and how to use it
  -   What is  `**kwargs`  and how to use it
  -   How to handle named arguments in a function
## Files
 - tests/ All files, classes and methods were tested and PEP 8 validated.
 - models/base.py, models/__init__.py This class will be the “base” of all other classes in this project. The goal of it is to manage `id` attribute in all your future classes and to avoid duplicating the same code (by extension, same bugs)
 - models/rectangle.py 
 - models/square.py
 - models/base.py
