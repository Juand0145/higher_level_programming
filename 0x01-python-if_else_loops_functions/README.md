## Learning objectives

In this directory, we will find a compilation of files that will help us to understand the uses of cycles and estatements in python and help us to answer the next questions:
-   How to use the  `if`,  `if ... else`  statements
-   How to affect values to variables
-   How to use the  `while`  and  `for`  loops
-   How is Python’s  `for`  different from  `C`‘s?
-   How to use the  `break`  and  `continues`  statements
-   How to use  `else`  clauses on loops
-  What does the  `pass`  statement do, and when to use it
-  How to use  `range`
-  What is a function and how do you use functions
-  What does return a function that does not use any  `return`  statement
-   Scope of variables
-   What’s a traceback
-   What are the arithmetic operators and how to use them

## Files

 - 0-positive_or_negative.py is a program will assign a random signed number to the variable `number` each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable `number` is positive or negative.
 - 1-last_digit.py is a program will assign a random signed number to the variable `number` each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable `number`.
 - 2-print_alphabet.py is a a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.
 - 3-print_alphabt.py is a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.
