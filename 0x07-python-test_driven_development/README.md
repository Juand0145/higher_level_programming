## Python - Test-driven development
In this repository, we will find a compilation of files that will help us to understand and how to use the unit test module in python and help us to answer the next questions:

 -   Whatâ€™s an interactive test
 -   Why tests are important
 -   How to write Docstrings to create tests
 -   How to write documentation for each module and function
 -   What are the basic option flags to create tests
 -   How to find edge cases
