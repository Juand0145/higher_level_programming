## Learning objectives

In this directory, we will find a compilation of files that will help us to understand the data structures work in python and how to use them in lists and help us to answer the next questions:

 1. -   What are lists and how to use them
 2. -   What are the differences and similarities between strings and lists
 3. -   What are the most common methods of lists and how to use them
 4. -   How to use lists as stacks and queues
 5. -   What are list comprehensions and how to use them
 6. -   What are tuples and how to use them
 7. -   When to use tuples versus lists
 8. -   What is a sequence
 9. -   What is tuple packing
 10. -   What is sequence unpacking
 11. -   What is the  `del`  statement and how to use it
